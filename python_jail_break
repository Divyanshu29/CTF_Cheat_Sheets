Most common ways for jail breaking in python
1.Most of the python jail may be implemented in eval() function and hence in order to crack we exploit use of eval.
Eg:(1)
Usage
	eval('1+3') gives output 4
	eval("os.system('ls')") gives listing provided import os is there in jail script and if not then eval("__import__('os').system('ls')")
	Sometimes regex is deployed to catch attempt to execute remote commands.So to bypass these we use chr() to evalute i.e eval(chr(95)+.....+chr	     (?)) where chr is the representation of the __import__('os').system('ls')
